## Overview

Led a comprehensive policy analysis to strengthen the long-term **financial sustainability** and **stakeholder engagement** of education-to-employment programs for adolescent girls in Liberia.

- Employed a **stakeholder analysis framework** and **evaluation matrix** to map and assess governmental, NGO, community, and donor involvement.
- Utilized **mixed-methods research** (policy review, data analysis, expert interviews) to identify chronic weaknesses in funding mechanisms, project management, and local buy-in.
- Highlighted the interplay between funding structures and gender equity outcomes in post-conflict, low-resource settings.

Developed and presented actionable recommendations to advance multi-sector partnerships, diversify funding sources, and build robust government and local ownershipâ€”ensuring the scalability and sustainability of vocational training initiatives.

## Key Contributions

- **Stakeholder Mapping & Analysis:** Mapped core stakeholder groups and constructed engagement strategies to drive local ownership and sustainability.
- **Evaluation Matrix & Mixed Methods:** Integrated quantitative data, policy review, and qualitative input from practitioner interviews to provide a holistic assessment of program sustainability.
- **Policy Recommendations:** Proposed a tiered engagement and co-financing model, local government integration, and transparent monitoring frameworks for broader adoption.
- **Impact:** Policy brief and proposal shared with World Bank-affiliated stakeholders and relevant Liberian agencies via direct outreach, with the potential to inform future discussions on funding models and program design for gender-responsive, sustainable skills development.
