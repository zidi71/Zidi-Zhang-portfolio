## Overview

Led a quantitative research project evaluating the psychometric properties of large-scale English Language Arts (ELA) assessments for approximately 4,000 K-12 students in a major U.S. district.

- Applied **Generalizability Theory (G-theory), Classical Test Theory (CTT), and Differential Item Functioning (DIF)** to assess test validity, score reliability, and subgroup fairness.
- Automated the full analytical pipeline in **R** (lme4, psych, corrr, sjPlot, etc.), streamlining data cleaning, statistical modeling, visualization, and reporting.
- Produced actionable methodological recommendations to improve assessment practices and ensure equitable score interpretation.

## Key Contributions

- Developed end-to-end, reproducible data science workflows—from raw data processing to interactive visualization and deliverables.
- Provided clear, evidence-based insights to school and district leadership, highlighting measurement limitations and equity considerations.
- Advanced the use of modern psychometric and statistical tools in district-level educational assessment for continuous improvement.
