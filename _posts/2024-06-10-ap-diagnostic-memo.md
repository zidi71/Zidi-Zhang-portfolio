## Overview

Conducted a multivariate quantitative analysis using student- and school-level data to identify key factors limiting AP exam participation and success among economically disadvantaged and English Learner (EL) students in Massachusetts.

Synthesized research literature, policy frameworks, and large-scale educational datasets (~300,000 K-12 records) to:

- Investigate equity gaps in AP course enrollment, exam participation, and pass rates.
- Diagnose the impact of demographic factors (e.g., economic disadvantage, EL status) and school context on AP pipeline outcomes.

Developed evidence-based recommendations to simplify AP exam access, increase targeted learning supports, and reduce systemic barriers to advanced coursework for underrepresented students.

## Key Contributions

- **Data Analysis:** Used R and Stata to conduct multivariate regression and pipeline analysis, clarifying where the largest dropout points for economically disadvantaged students occur (course access vs. test taking vs. passing).
- **Equity Lens:** Focused analysis on how AP access and success rates differ by socioeconomic status and EL status, highlighting disparities and actionable gaps.
- **Policy Recommendations:** Proposed interventions including:
    - Simplified, multilingual AP exam registration & outreach
    - School-based learning support pilots for ED and EL students, including academic counseling and targeted tutoring
    - Improved communication of AP opportunities and financial supports to families
- **Stakeholder Impact:** Policy brief shared with state education officials; findings used as a basis for administrative decision-making and advocacy for equitable AP opportunities.
